# Todo Application with Categories in React.js

This is a simple **Todo Application** built using **React.js** that helps users organize tasks into three categories: **Todo**, **Doing**, and **Done**. The application allows users to:

- Add tasks to each category.
- Move tasks between categories as they progress.
- Delete tasks once they're finished.

The project is created with React.js and uses state management for handling the tasks. Itâ€™s a great way to learn about React components, state, and the flow of data.

## Features

- **Three Categories**:
  - **Todo**: Tasks that need to be done.
  - **Doing**: Tasks that are currently being worked on.
  - **Done**: Tasks that have been completed and can be deleted.
  
- **Add Tasks**: Add tasks to any of the three categories.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list once they are done.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available: 

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
